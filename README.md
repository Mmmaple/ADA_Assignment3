1.Design and implement a data structure for holding integer values which has O(log2 n) add, contains and remove methods, as well as an eﬃcient minGap method that returns the diﬀerence between the two closest numbers currently in the data structure. Include a suitable main method to test the data structure. Hint: you can augment the class RedBlackTree that was prepared in the lab (an implementation of the remove method is not required).
